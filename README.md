# Evidence
An Android app designed around gathering evidence with convenience and security as top priorities.

Yeah yeah GitHub, thanks for that. I'll take it from here.

### What is the Evidence Android App?
Evidence is an app built for recording, storing and managing evidence data to both local and remote locations with efficiency and security at the heart of the design.

### What steps have you taken to secure the app
The app, as I've mentioned many-a-time, is designed around having an inpenitrable security model. It uses RSA-256 bit encryption on all data stored locally, using cryptographic methods that are unbreakable.

lmao this isn't supposed to be some business pitch this is just an app I'm making because I'm bored. Yeah it's secure, yeah it's fancy, don't need to explain myself do I.
